## Project Values

Current academic ranking systems, such as CS Rankings, focus heavily on publication count and reputation. This often incentivizes quantity over impactful work. Our project introduces a **new CS PhD university ranking system** that prioritizes **publication quality** using **LLMs** and **graph-based influence scoring**.  

**Key Values:**  
- Fair and transparent ranking  
- Focus on research impact, not just volume  
- Equitable treatment of collaborative work  
- Target users: prospective PhD students, academic advisors, funding agencies, and policymakers

## Technical Documentation

### Architecture Overview

Our system is a **microservice-based pipeline** with the following core components:

1. **PDF Downloader**  
   - Fetches papers via URLs from a provided CSV dataset

2. **Author Extraction**  
   - Matches papers to authors using the **DBLP API**  
   - Resolves naming inconsistencies and affiliation data

3. **LLM Paper Scoring**  
   - Uses **deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B** to evaluate paper quality by pulling the 5 most important references from the paper.  
   - Scoring pipeline parses LLM responses, calculates impact, and stores results

4. **Author Influence Graph**  
   - Nodes: Authors  
   - Edges: Citation links, weighted as `1 / number_of_authors`  
   - Author scores are aggregated to compute university scores

### FAQ

**Q: How are university rankings calculated?**  
A: Rankings are based on research quality, not just quantity. We use a language model to assess paper and return the 5 most important references to showcase impact and construct a citation-based author influence graph.

**Q: Where does your data come from?**  
A: We use a curated dataset of CS papers from the top CS conferences and author metadata from DBLP, with PDF links for full-text analysis.

**Q: What makes this different from CS Rankings?**  
A: Unlike CS Rankings, we account for paper impact using LLM evaluation and fair contribution scoring via graph-based aggregation.

**Q: Why are some universities missing?**  
A: We only include institutions with verifiable publication data. Some universities may be excluded due to missing or ambiguous author affiliations.

**Q: How are co-authored papers scored?**  
A: Credit is distributed fairly among co-authors. In the influence graph, each citation link is weighted by 1 / number of authors.

**Q: Can I suggest improvements or report issues?**  
A: Yes! Please open an issue or pull request on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Lianghui818/revolutionizing-higher-ed-rankings) to contribute or report bugs.

4,"The proposed PRM module. pedestrians, we design a part-based relation module (PRM) as shown in Fig. 6(b). For a current pedestrian candi- date, the PRM module will favor its counterparts with sim- ilar visible parts and assign them large adaptive weights in aggregating features. For the example in Fig. 6(a), we want to use the embedding features of upper-body to mea- sure the semantic similarity between bkt tandbkt+τ t+τ, since both their upper parts are visible. To this end, given a pair ofbkt tandbki i, the PRM module ﬁrst applies a seg- mentation subnetwork Nsegtoxkt tto predict the visible maskvkt=Nseg(xkt t)for the current pedestrian candidate, wherevkt∈[0,1]7×7×1. Next, the adaptive weight wki iis computed using an improved semantic similarity function sPRM(·), which is deﬁned in terms of vkt: sPRM(ekt t,eki i) =1 |V|/summationdisplay p∈Vekt t(p)·eki i(p) |ekt t(p)||eki i(p)|, (10) whereV={p|vkt(p)/greaterorequalslantmin{0.5,γ}}andγis a thresh- old which adaptively determined by vkt. For background, the values in vkttend to be zero. In order to retain enough pixels for computing the semantic similarity for background proposals, γis set to a value such that at least 20% pixels in embedding features are retained. The percentile 20% is chosen according to the deﬁnition of heavy occlusion in ex- isting pedestrian dataset: a pedestrian is considered to be heavily occluded if only 20%−65% of its body is visible.",2

4,"to high-level semantics [41], to meet a user’s preferences, which has numerous potential applications in video games, image editing, and computer-aided design. Recently, with the development of deep learning and deep generative models, automatic image manipulation has made remark- able progress, including image inpainting [12, 25], image colourisation [40], style transfer [9, 14], and domain or at- tribute translation [13, 16].",5
5,"All the above works mainly focus on speciﬁc problems, and few studies [6, 23] concentrate on more general and user-friendly image manipulation by using natural language descriptions. More precisely, the task aims to semantically edit parts of an image according to the given text provided by a user, while preserving other contents that are not de- scribed in the text. However, current state-of-the-art text-guided image manipulation methods are only able to pro- duce low-quality images (see Fig. 1: ﬁrst row), far from satisfactory, and even fail to effectively manipulate complex scenes (see Fig. 1: second row).",2

1,"Introduction In the computer vision ﬁeld, many tasks can be consid- ered as image layer mixture/separation problems. For ex- ample, when we take a picture on rainy days, the image obtained can be viewed as a mixture of two layers: a rain- streak layer and a clean background layer. When we look through a transparent glass, we see a mixture of the scene beyond the glass and the scene reﬂected by the glass. Separating superimposed images with a single obser- vation has long been an important but challenging task. On one hand, it forms the foundation of a large group of real-world applications, including transparency separation, shadow removal, deraining, etc. On the other hand, it is nat- urally a massively ill-posed problem, where the difﬁculty *Corresponding author: Zhengxia Zou (zzhengxi@umich.edu)lies not only in the absence of the mixture function but also in the lack of constraints on the output space. In recent literature, most of the above-mentioned tasks are investi- gated individually despite the strong correlation between them [8, 23, 48, 54, 59, 60]. In this paper, we propose a new framework for single superimposed image separation, as shown in Fig 1, which deals with all the above tasks un- der a uniﬁed framework. Learning a priori for image decomposition. Given a single superimposed image, as we have no extra con- straint on the output space, there could be an inﬁnite num- ber of possible decomposition. Previous works often in- tegrate hard-crafted priors to apply additional constraints to their separation outputs. For example, in recent litera- ture [17, 67], researchers introduced the “gradient exclu- siveness” [67] and the “internal self-similarity” [17], where the former one emphasizes the independence of the layers to be separated in their gradient domain, and the latter one assumes that the distribution of small patches within each separate layer should be “simpler” (more uniform) than in the original mixed one. However, these hand-crafted priors may introduce unexpected bias and thus fails in complex mixture conditions. In this paper, we investigate an inter- esting question: can a good prior be learned from data? To answer this question, we re-examine the prior under a to- tally different point of view by taking advantage of the re- cent success of generative adversarial networks [19, 28, 47]. We introduce a “Separation-Critic” - a discriminative net- workDC, which is trained to identify whether the output layers are well-separated. The layer separation thus can be gradually enforced by fooling the Critic under an adversar- ial training paradigm. Crossroad loss function. In addition to the Critic DC, we also introduce a layer separator Gand train it to min- imize the distance between the separated outputs and the ground truth references. However, a standard l1orl2loss does not apply to our task since the Gmay predict un- ordered outputs. We, therefore, introduce a “crossroad l1” loss which computes the distance between the outputs and their references in a crossover fashion. In this way, the train- 12806 Figure 1: We propose a uniﬁed framework for single mixed image separation under an adversarial training paradigm. Our method can be applied to a variety of real-world tasks, including image deraining, photo reﬂection removal, image shadow removal, etc. ing can be well-instructed by pixel-wise supervision. Confronting nonlinear mixture and degradation. In some real-world image separation tasks, the mixture of im- ages is usually beyond linear. For example, the formation of a reﬂection image may depend not only on the relative position of the camera to the image plane but also on light- ing conditions [59]. Besides, the degradation (e.g., over- exposure and noise) may further increase the difﬁculty of the separation. In these conditions, one may need inject- ing “imagination” into the algorithm to recover the hidden structure of degraded data. Inspired by the recent image translation methods [28], we further introduce two Marko- vian discriminators (PatchGAN) to improve the perceptual quality of the outputs. Experimental results show that our method signiﬁcantly outperforms other popular image separation frameworks [17, 35]. We apply our method to a variety of computer vi- sion tasks. Without speciﬁcally tuning, we achieve the state of the art results on nine datasets of three different tasks, in- cluding image deraining, photo reﬂection removal, and im- age shadow removal. To our best knowledge, this is the ﬁrst uniﬁed framework for solving these problems as most previous solutions on these tasks are separately investigated and designed.",2
2,"Methodology We frame the training of our model as a pixel-wise re- gression process with the help of adversarial losses. Our method consists of an image separator G, a Separation CriticDCand two Markovian discriminators DM1and DM2. Fig. 2 shows an overview of our method.3.1. Crossroad l1Loss Function Supposeˆx1andˆx2represent two individual images and y=f(ˆx1,ˆx2)represents their mixture. We assume the operation f(·)is unknown and could be either a linear or a non-linear mixing function. Given a mixed input y, our separator aims to predict two individual outputs x1andx2: x1, x2=G(y), (1) that recover the two original images ˆx1andˆx2. We train the separator Gto minimize the distance be- tween its outputs ( x1,x2) and their ground truth ( ˆx1,ˆx2). Note that since we can not specify the order of the two out- puts for a typical image decomposition problem (especially when the ˆx1andˆx2are from the same image domain), the standard pixel-wise l1orl2loss functions do not apply to our task. The solution to this problem is to introduce new loss functions that can deal with unordered outputs. We therefore propose a new loss function called “crossroad l1” loss for our task. The main idea behind is to crossly com- pute the distance by exchanging the order of the outputs and then take their minimum value as the ﬁnal response: lcross((x1,x2),(ˆx1,ˆx2)) =min{d1,1+d2,2, d1,2+d2,1}(2) wheredi,j=/bardblxi−ˆxj/bardbl1,i,j∈ {1,2}. We use the standard l1function rather than l2indi,jsince it encourages less blurring effect. The Gcan be therefore trained to minimize the lossLcross on an entire dataset: Lcross(G) =Eˆxi∼pi(ˆxi){lcross((x1,x2),(ˆx1,ˆx2))},(3) wherepi(ˆxi)represents the distribution of the image data, andi∈ {1,2}. 3.2. Separation Critic Considering the layer ambiguity, instead of applying any hand-crafted [67] or statistics-based constraints [27] to 12808 Figure 3: We compare different decomposition priors for image separation, including the “exclusion loss” [17, 67], “Kurtosis” [27], and the proposed “Separation-Critic”. For either of the three metrics, a lower score indicates a heav- ier mixture. In sub-ﬁgure (a), we plot the response of the three metrics given a set of mixed inputs that are synthe- sized based on Eq. (5). Clearly, if a metric is good enough, the response should be monotonically decreasing as αin- creases. We also test on additional nonlinear corruptions, including (b) overexposure, (c) random gamma correction, and (d) random hue transform. The proposed Critic shows better robustness in all conditions. our output space, we learn a decomposition prior through an adversarial training process. We therefore introduce a “Separation-Critic” DCwhich is trained to distinguish between the outputs (x1,x2)and a pair of clean images (ˆx1,ˆx2), and is independent on the order of the two inputs. We express its objective function as follows: Lcritic(G,DC) =Eˆxi∼pi(ˆxi){logDC(ˆx1,ˆx2)} +Exi∼pi(xi){log(1−DC(x1,x2))} +Eˆxi∼pi(ˆxi){log(1−DC(mix(ˆx1,ˆx2)))}.(4) Note that when training the DCwith fake samples, in ad- dition to the decomposed output (x1,x2), we also synthe- size a set of “fake” images by mixing two clean images (x′ 1,x′",2
3,"Related Work Superimposed image separation. In signal process- ing, a similar topic to our paper is Blind Source Separation (BSS) [5, 14–16, 27], which aims to separate source sig- nals from a set of mixed ones. The research of this topic can be traced back to the 1990s [26], where the Indepen- dent Component Analysis (ICA) [27] was a representativeof the methods at the time. The key to estimating the ICA model is the Central Limit Theorem, i.e., the distribution of a sum of two images tends toward a Gaussian distribu- tion, under certain conditions. Some statistics-based criteria thus have been introduced to measure the independence and non-Gaussianity of the images, e.g., Kurtosis and negative entropy. The main difference between the BSS and our task is that the former one typically requires multiple mixed in- puts [14–16, 27] or additional user interactions [35], while the latter one does not. We focus on the latter case since multiple mixed inputs or user interactions are not always available in practice. Recently, Gandelsman et al. proposed a deep learning-based method called Double-DIP [17] that can separate superimposed images with a single observation under certain conditions. However, their method can only handle the input with regular mixed patterns. Related applications. Many real-world tasks can be viewed as special cases of superimposed image separation:",2
4,"Single Image Deraining. A rainy image can be sim- ply viewed as a superposition of a clean background image and rain streaks. Some early deraining methods were de- signed based on low-rank constraints [4, 41, 42, 71] and sparse coding methods [20, 29, 43, 57], where the rain- streaks are considered as high frequency noise. How- ever, these methods usually lead to over-smoothed results. Recent deraining methods typically formulate the derain- ing as a deep learning based “image-to-image” translation process which is trained with pixel-wise regression loss [12, 13, 23, 39, 55, 62, 64].",2
5,"Reﬂection-removal. Early reﬂection removal methods often require additional input images [35] and hand-crafted priors on estimating the reﬂection layer. Such priors include 12807 Figure 2: An overview of our method. Our method consists of a separator Gand several discriminators. The G, which is trained under a “crossroad l1” loss, aims to decompose a single mixed input into two individual images. To identify whether the separation is good or not, we introduce a “Critic” DC, which is trained together with Gunder an adversarial training paradigm. We further use two Markovian Discriminators ( DM1,DM2) to improve the perceptual quality of the outputs. the smoothness prior [40, 51], gradient sparsity constraint [2, 36, 37], ghost cues [51], etc. In Recent methods, the priors are usually explored by data-driven methods [9, 44, 53, 60] and adversarial training/synthesis [59, 67], which better handle more complex reﬂections.",2

1,Probabilistic Pixel-Adaptive Convolutions,2
2,"We base our approach on pixel-adaptive convolutions (PACs) [51]. Here, the convolution kernels are split into a ﬁxed weight as well as a location-speciﬁc component that depends upon a feature embedding learned from guidance data. PACs have a small computational overhead and are easy to train in practice. Nevertheless, like most adaptive ﬁltering approaches, PACs do not allow to explicitly lever- age knowledge about the reliability of ﬁlter inputs. While such information can be included as guidance data for the content-adaptive part of the weight kernel, our explicit prob- abilistic formulation leads to a signiﬁcant performance gain.",2
3,"Closest to ours with regard to probabilistic joint ﬁltering are [22, 29], where conﬁdences are used to extend the bilateral and the guided ﬁlter, respectively, by weighing a pixel’s im- portance with its conﬁdence. However, both methods rely on predeﬁned features for pixel similarity, hand-crafted re- liability measures, and ﬁxed ﬁlter kernels.",3
4,"Beyond such general purpose probabilistic treatments, probabilistic networks have also been developed in the con- text of speciﬁc vision problems. Yin et al . [60] propose a method to aggregate correspondence uncertainty in the context of optical ﬂow and stereo matching through various spatial scales. In [27], a multi-hypothesis network for opti- cal ﬂow estimation is trained to output an ensemble at once.",2
5,"In comparison to previous work, our approach is very general as pixel feature embeddings, the ﬁlter weights, aswell as a pre-processing of the probabilities are learned from data. Moreover, the proposed approach is fast and eas- ily integrable into different task-speciﬁc neural networks.",4

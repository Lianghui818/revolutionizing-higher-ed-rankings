<h1>Website</h1>
<h3>Code by Torin Perkins and Aaron Ducote, documentation by Elliot Foley</h3>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
Display the data once we have it
<h2>Details and Usage</h2>
Currently, simply view the .HTML file in a browser, that's it
<h2>TODO</h2>
There is a lot of work that still needs to be done:
<ul>
	<li>Add a list of checkboxes to the HTML with descriptions like "AI" or "Security"</li>
	<li>Add clientside JS to the site to dynamically rank the Universities</li>
	<li>Add a way for the JS to read from a file which contains ranking data</li>
	<li>Find where to host this website</li>
	<li>Probably more</li>
</ul>
